This is a course on the topics as you can see is about the integrity and the anti-corruption.
We started to learn about this topic since primary school. As you know, to avoid or to lessen the cases
of corruption, one of the way is to provide educations or teachings to the public. In my opinion,
it is very important to implant this concept and thinking since we are still young. 

This course also emphasizes the importance of value systems and ethics, which include aspects of human relationships and managing/appreciating diversity. In addition, this course also emphasizes holistic solutions to current issues, transformation and innovation, philosophy of science and technology based on values, integrity and self-identity towards achieving the goal of producing excellent graduates in terms of physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual
