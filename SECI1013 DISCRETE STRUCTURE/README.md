<h2><p align = "center" >SECI1013 DISCRETE STRUCTURE 📐<br/>
Lecturer - Dr Noorfa Haszlinna binti Mustaffa 💁<p/></h2>

In my perspective, discrete structure is a course similar to the Modern Mathematics in the field of computer science. 
The topics include set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite automata. 
I should now able to solve the computer science problems, real world problems and to model electronic devices and problems using the knowledges I got from the topics..
