Lecturer - Dr.Aryati Binti Bakri 💁<p/></h2>
<h2>Reflection 💬</h2>
TIS is a combination of information systems and technology (IS/IT) and has become indispensable elements in our daily lives. TIS covers a broad spectrum of IS/IT including hardware, software, network and communications. This semester I have mastered the basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools such as GitHub via practical work in the labs or in my assignments. Futhermore, Dr Aryati also brought me to industry visits which is also part of the work-based learning of this course. These industry visits and talks allowed me to explore the actual working environment and fostering my industry knowledge. This course has provided me with a profound understanding of the qualifications necessary for my future career aspirations.
