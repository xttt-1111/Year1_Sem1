Lecturer - Dr. Alif Ridzuan bin Khairuddin 💁<p/></h2>

PT1 equips us with the theory and basic practices on programming using C++ programming language.
It is the most easy and simple language to enhance our fundamentals in coding and to moderate problems.

This course covers the following: <br/>
-pre-processor directives<br/>
-constants and variables<br/>
-data types<br/>
-input and output statements<br/>
-control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions,
single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.<br/>

<h2>Reflection 💬</h2>
I remember my goal before entering UTM is to master the basics of the C++ programming language and i could say that I did it!
I hope I can also master the other programming languanges well in the future such as the Python and Java.
Setting goal is a way for me myself to improve.
